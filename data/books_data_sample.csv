Sweet Talkers (Richard Kasak Books),"""An anthology of writing by women about their first-time erotic experiences with other women. From the longings and ecstasies of awakening dykes to the sometimes awkward pleasures of sexual experimentation on the edge, each of these true stories reveals a different, radical perspective on one of the most traditional subjects around: virginity. The writers-as-sexual-pioneers in this collection focus on the pleasures of exploring this unfamiliar, intimate terrain while searching for-- and perhaps discovering--the truth about the truth about their own desires and boundaries. This important collection promises to boldly challenge popular accounts of women's sexual identities and experiences with other women--and define erotic and literary territory that has been, until now, uncharted."" -- Publisher's description.",['Shar Rednour'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=qfNKSwjWEzMC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=qfNKSwjWEzMC&q=Sweet+Talkers+(Richard+Kasak+Books)&dq=Sweet+Talkers+(Richard+Kasak+Books)&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Richard Kasak Books,1996,http://books.google.com/books?id=qfNKSwjWEzMC&dq=Sweet+Talkers+(Richard+Kasak+Books)&hl=&source=gbs_api,"['Erotic stories, American']",

Neo-conservatism: The Autobiography of an Idea,"Neoconservatism is the movement that has provided the intellectual foundation for the resurgence of American conservatism in our time. And if neoconservatism can be said to have a father or an architect, that person is Irving Kristol. Neoconservatism is the most comprehensive selection of Kristol's influential writings on politics and economics, as well as the best of his now-famous essays on society, religion, culture, literature, education, and - above all - the ""values"" issues that have come to define the neo-conservative critique of contemporary life. These essays provide an unparalleled insight into the 50-year development of Kristol's social and political ideas, from an uneasy socialism tempered with religious orthodoxy, to a vigilant optimism about the future of the American experiment. Those already familiar with Kristol's work will especially enjoy the new autobiographical essay that introduces this volume; it is sprinkled with personal recollections about such luminaries as Lionel Trilling, Leo Strauss, Saul Bellow, Sidney Hook, Daniel Patrick Moynihan, and historian Gertrude Himmelfarb (who is also Mrs. Kristol). Those relatively new to Kristol's writings will be treated to some of the most lucid, insightful, entertaining, and intellectually challenging essays of our time.",['Irving Kristol'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=S2nUuTagIw8C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.nl/books?id=S2nUuTagIw8C&printsec=frontcover&dq=Neo-conservatism:+The+Autobiography+of+an+Idea&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Simon and Schuster,1995-09-20,http://books.google.nl/books?id=S2nUuTagIw8C&dq=Neo-conservatism:+The+Autobiography+of+an+Idea&hl=&source=gbs_api,['Political Science'],1.0

Colony,"In 1979, as violence erupts all over Ireland, two outsiders travel to a small island off the west coast in search of their own answers, despite what it may cost the islanders. It is the summer of 1979. An English painter travels to a small island off the west coast of Ireland. Mr. Lloyd takes the last leg by currach, though boats with engines are available and he doesn’t much like the sea. He wants the authentic experience, to be changed by this place, to let its quiet and light fill him, give him room to create. He doesn’t know that a Frenchman follows close behind. Jean-Pierre Masson has visited the island for many years, studying the language of those who make it their home. He is fiercely protective of their isolation, deems it essential to exploring his theories of language preservation and identity. But the people who live on this rock—three miles long and half a mile wide—have their own views on what is being recorded, what is being taken, and what ought to be given in return. Over the summer, each of them—from great-grandmother Bean Uí Fhloinn, to widowed Mairéad, to fifteen-year-old James, who is determined to avoid the life of a fisherman—will wrestle with their values and desires. Meanwhile, all over Ireland, violence is erupting. And there is blame enough to go around. An expertly woven portrait of character and place, a stirring investigation into yearning to find one’s way, and an unflinchingly political critique of the long, seething cost of imperialism, Audrey Magee’s The Colony is a novel that transports, that celebrates beauty and connection, and that reckons with the inevitable ruptures of independence.",['Audrey Magee'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=B6o9EAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=B6o9EAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Colony&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,"Farrar, Straus and Giroux",2022-05-17,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=B6o9EAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,['Fiction'],

"Fair Ways: How Six Black Golfers Won Civil Rights in Beaumont, Texas (Centennial Series of the Association of Former Students, Texas A&M; University)","Annotation In the summer of 1955, six African American golfers in Beaumont, Texas, began attacking the Jim Crow caste system when they filed a federal lawsuit for the right to play the municipal golf course. The golfers and their African American lawyers went to federal court and asked a conservative white Republican judge to render a decision that would not only integrate the local golf course but also set precedent for desegregation of other public facilities. In Fair Ways, Robert J. Robertson chronicles three parallel stories that converged in this important case. He tells the story of the plaintiffs-avid golfers who had learned the game while working as caddies and waiters-of their young lawyers, recent graduates from Howard University law school, and of the Republican judge just appointed to the bench by President Eisenhower. Using public case papers, public records, newspapers, and oral histories, Robertson has recreated the scene in Beaumont on the eve of desegregation. Fair Ways gives a vivid picture of racial segregation and the forces that brought about its end.",['Robert J.

A Brief History of Qi,"A Brief History of Qi takes the reader through the mysterious terrain of Chinese Medicine, Chinese language, Chinese martial arts and Qi Gong - a truly evocative guide to virtually all the traditional Chinese arts and sciences. This book is devoted to a topic represented by a single Chinese character, Qi. When presented with the concept of Qi, students of Chinese culture, Chinese medicine, Chinese martial arts and a wide range of Chinese traditional arts and sciences face one of the most perplexing challenges of their tenure. The book begins with an examination of Qi's linguistic and literary roots, stretching back through the shadowy mists of Chinese pre-civilisation. The authors then trace the development of the concept of Qi through a number of related traditional Chinese disciplines including painting, poetry, medicine and martial arts. The book concludes with an examination of the depth and breadth of Qi as manifested in life's cycles.","['Yu Huan Zhang', 'Ken Rose']",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=701u-PHNAuMC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=701u-PHNAuMC&printsec=frontcover&dq=A+Brief+History+of+Qi&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Paradigm Publications,2001,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=701u-PHNAuMC&source=gbs_api,['Medical'],
